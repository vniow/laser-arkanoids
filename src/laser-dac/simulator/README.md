# laser-server-simulator

This version is based off the simulator package from the [Laser DAC project on GitHub](https://github.com/Volst/laser-dac).

I've added the functionality to handle events from the webpage it hosts at `localhost:8080` directly, namely mouse clicks and keyboard presses. This should more easily enable other input functionality.
