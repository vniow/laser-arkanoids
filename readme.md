## What is this

I've been tecahing myself programming using the
[laser-dac library](https://github.com/Volst/laser-dac) to create some simple games. This repo serves as the base for the interactivity portion using a modified version of the simulator package to work with mouse and keyboard inputs.

**Note:** I do not have a laser to test this. Do you? Let's get in touch.

# How to use

0. Ensure you've got `node` and `npm` set up. I'm using node v18 LTS and npm 8.15.

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` to `/src`
3. Run `npm i`
4. Run `npm run build`
5. Run `npm run dev`
6. Visit http://localhost:8080 in your fav browser

You should be seeing something like this:

To interact, press the spacebar to change the bounds dimensions and colour, and press the mouse to change the colour of the bouncing ball.

Enjoy.
